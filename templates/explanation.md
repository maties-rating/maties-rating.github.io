# 🏓 Rating System Explained

We use an [**ELO Rating System**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), commonly used in:

- [Chess](https://www.chess.com/terms/elo-rating-chess)
- [USA Table Tennis](https://www.usatt.org/events-and-results/rating-systems-explained)
- [German Table Tennis](https://www.ttbl.de/)
- [Australian Table Tennis](https://www.tabletennis.org.au/high-performance/rankings)

### 📊 How It Works

1. **Default Rating**: New players start with a default rating.
2. **Official Events**: Only **official events** count — e.g., Club/Provincial Tournaments, CT League, SA Nationals, USSAs.
3. **Database Entry**: When a result is submitted, you're assigned a **Maties Player ID** and added to our database.
4. **Rating Calculation**: Ratings are calculated using match outcomes and our internal formula.
5. **Basic Idea**:  
   - Winners **gain** points.  
   - Losers **lose** points.  
   - Upsets (lower-rated player beats higher-rated one) result in **bigger rating shifts**.
6. **Minimum Results**: You need **at least 6 official matches** logged for a **visible rating**.
7. **Inactivity**: Players inactive for **12+ months** will have their ratings reset.
8. **Long-Term Accuracy**: The system evolves over time to reflect a player’s **current skill**. We may use it for **national rankings** and **tournament seeding**.
